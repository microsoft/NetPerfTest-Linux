.SYNOPSIS
    Set up (or clean up) PSRemoting on this computer. Setup up option will enable OpenSSH Server, Firewall and setup the machine to be able to run ps commands programmatically
    Cleanup up option will disbable OpenSSH Server and perform other tasks that were done during setup like disable ufw firewall, delete remoting specific firewall rules, etc.

.PARAMETER Setup
    This Switch will trigger the setup calls which ends up starting the OpenSSH Server service and enable powershell remoting via SSH and opens up remoting via the firewall

.PARAMETER Cleanup
    This switch triggers the cleanup path which disables OpenSSH Server, removes the firewall rules that were created earlier for remoting

.PARAMETER Port
    The port that the SSH Server will listen on. Default is 5985. 

.PARAMETER PassAuth
    Required Parameter. Get the password of this computer to modify firewall permissions.

    .DESCRIPTION
    Run this script to setup your machine for PS Remoting so that you can leverage the functionality of runPerfTool.psm1
    Run this script at the end of the tool runs to restore state on the machines.
    Ex: SetupTearDown.ps1 -Setup or SetupTearDown.ps1 -Cleanup
